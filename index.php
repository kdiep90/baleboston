					<p>We are a small family business that loves to provide food for the local community. We opened in 1996 in Boston and customer demand has gotten so high that we also had to open another location in Quincy in 2006!</p>
					<p>We were voted #1 by Boston Magazine, the Boston Globe, and many other publications for food quality, taste, and customer service. We not only have the best Vietnamese food in Boston, but we also have great vegan food, scrumptious desserts, fresh-squeezed sugar cane juice, and more! We even have our very own famous artisan French baguette created due to popular customer demand! We are the best Vietnamese sandwich shop in Boston, but don't just take our word for it.
